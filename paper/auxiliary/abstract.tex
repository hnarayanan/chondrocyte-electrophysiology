\maketitle

\abstract{We have developed a computational model for studying the
  electrophysiology of the human chondrocyte.  This model is based on
  an initial experimental data set, which has identified the main K+
  currents that are expressed in these isolated single cells form knee
  joints of healthy adult human donors. The applicability and utility
  of this model are illustrated by focusing on the role of a novel
  2-pore K$^{+}$ current in regulating the chondrocyte resting
  potential and modulating intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis.  This
  model is demonstrated to be useful for integrating available data
  from electrophysiological, PCR and gene array experiments.  It is
  also an important adjunct for rationalization of working hypotheses,
  design of new experiments and understanding the principles and
  limitations of patch clamp methods applied to the isolated human
  chondrocyte.}
