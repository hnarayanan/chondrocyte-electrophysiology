\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

Articular cartilage is flexible connective tissue that permits stability and movement of the skeleton. 
This connective tissue consists of an extracellular matrix (composed primarily of collagen, elastin and proteoglycans) and one type of cell---the {\em chondrocyte}---which is responsible for synthesis and homeostasis of the matrix. 
Under abnormal conditions, chondrocyte damage may occur and the balance between matrix synthesis and degradation is lost, causing inflammation of the tissue and/or osteoarthritis: a wearing out of the cartilage layer which causes painful, bone-against-bone friction.

It is generally known that the progression of osteoarthritis (Rush and Hall, 2003) and limited recovery of chondrocytes (Jones et al, 1999) is linked to poorly-regulated volume changes (Lewis et al, 2011) and physical damage to cartilage is easier in the context of reduced osmolarity (Bushet et al, 2005).
In turn, there is indication that these volume changes are linked to abnormal maintenance of resting membrane potential in these cells (Lewis et al, 2011).
In unhealthy cells, the response to challenging external stimuli may change (e.g. much larger changes in resting membrane potential) (Lewis et al, 2011; WIlson, et al 2004; Tsuga 2002; Tirabashi 2010a).
It has been suggested that these changes in the regulation of the resting membrane potential are due to altered ion channel function (Lewis et al, 2011; WIlson, et al 2004; Tsuga 2002; Tirabashi 2010a).
Direct experimental investigation of the link between chondrocyte electrophysiology and chondrotoxicity is complicated, however, by chondrocytes' small cell size and the associated limitations of in vitro electrophysiological studies (cite?).
We have thus developed and present here a detailed, biophysically-based model of chondrocyte electrophysiology.
The first of its kind, the model will facilitate investigation of questions related to chondrocyte electrophysiology and signaling, and provides a profound basis for subsequent models of chondrocyte and articular pathophysiology.

Osteoarthritic changes may develop in even young patients following orthopedic surgery (cite) via chondrolysis, a condition in which accelerated loss of articular cartilage occurs over a short time period (Webb editorial, 2009).
Several clinical studies have suggested that this significant chondrotoxicity can occur as a result of postoperative administration of bupivacaine, a local anesthetic (Busfield and Romero, 2009; Bailie and Ellenbecker, 2009; Rapley et al, 2009; Wiater, et al, 2011). 
Experimental work has confirmed that bupivacaine reveals profound chondrotoxic effects in both cell (Chu et al, 2006) and animal studies (Gomoll et al, 2006; Chu et al, 2010).
It appears that the mechanism of toxicity is unrelated to the primary mechanism of action of bupivacaine: the blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels (cite), and instead may be related to potassium channel blockade (Grishko, et al, 2010). 
Although the exact mechanisms leading to chondrotoxicity in this context remain unclear,


Additionally, it is known that the family of two-pore K+ channels is likely affected by postoperative bupivacaine administration (Clark et al, manuscript; Punke et al 2003).
We therefore hypothesize that the blockade of the two-pore K+ channel in human articular chondrocytes by the local anesthetic bupivacaine leads to abnormal regulation of the resting membrane potential in these cells, which may concomitantly lead to abnormal volume regulation, altered signaling, and cell death.
The aims of this paper are: (1) to present a novel model of chondrocyte electrophysiology in detail and, (2) to employ this model to investigate the stated hypothesis.
